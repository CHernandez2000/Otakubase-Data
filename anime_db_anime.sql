Through this encounter, Tetsuo begins to develop his own mysterious abilities, as the government seeks to quarantine this latest psychic in a desperate attempt to prevent him from unleashing the destructive power that could once again bring the city to its knees.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]','Akira',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Character is unavailable',693270,'Seinen',3653,'2 hr 4 min',NULL,1,14467,'Action, Horror, Sci-Fi','https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1408/114012.jpg',NULL,5987,196691,209,'Mainichi Broadcasting System, Kodansha, Pioneer LDC, Bandai, TOHO, Sumitomo, Hakuhodo','R+ - Mild Nudity',455,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Manga','1988-07-16T00:00:00+00:00','Finished Airing','Tokyo Movie Shinsha','Gore, Military, Super Power',916235,'https://www.youtube.com/embed/lG2WL9brJr0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG2WL9brJr0','Movie','https://myanimelist.net/anime/47/Akira',16634,NULL),(48,6.94,'A young wavemaster, only known by the alias of Tsukasa, wakes up in an MMORPG called The World, with slight amnesia.
